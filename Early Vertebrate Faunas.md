\*Gogo Formation Lagerstatte\*: Long and Trinajstic (2010): "The Gogo Formation has been dated as Late Givetian (\*hermanni\* Zone) to early Frasnian (\*falsiovalis\* to \*punctata\* conodont Zones), based on revision of the conodont fauna and radiolarians

from the upper part of the formation (Nazarov et al. 1982, Nazarov & Ormiston 1983, Klapper 2009). The fish-bearing nodules primarily contain conodonts of the \*transitans\* conodont Zone." Here we adopte the \*\*early Frasnian\*\* age.

The arthrodire placoderms exhibit the highest diversity and abundance (Long and Trinajstic 2010) among around \*\*50\*\* species. Arthrodires include \*Holonema westolli\* Miles 1971; \*Latocamurus coulthardi\* Long, 1988; \*Mcnamaraspis kaprios\* Long, 1995; \*Incisoscutum ritchiei\* Dennis and Miles, 1981; etc. \*\*Count how many?\*\*
