### Griesbachian, Induan, Early Triassic
**Greenland**: 
Previously undescribed specimens of Saurichthys from the basal part of the Early Triassic Wordie Creek Formation (Griesbachian) of East Greenland demonstrate a remarkably complete squamation especially in the anterior trunk portion. Saurichthys aff. dayi (Raymond, 1925)

The Early Triassic fishes of East Greenland originate from six horizons (Nielsen 1942; Nielsen 1949; Perch-Nielsen et al., 1974), the lower five of which(“fish-zones” I–V) aredated as early to late Griesbachian (Surlyk et al., 2017), whereas the sixth horizon is early Dienerian in age (see below). 

Although the ichthyofaunal compositions of these six horizons differ (Nielsen 1961), collectively they show that all of the typical Early Triassic taxa were already present in the Griesbachian: Australosomus, Birgeria, Bobasatrania, Boreosomus (Ptycholepidae), (Platysiagidae), parasemionotids Parasemionotus, ??Errolichthys, (Broughia, Helmolepis Ospia, ? Watsonulus) Pteronisculus, Saurichthys, ? Teffichthys (“Perleidus”; Marramà et al., 2017), Sassenia, and Whiteia (Stensiö 1932; Nielsen 1936; Nielsen 1942; Nielsen 1949; Nielsen 1952; Nielsen 1955; Nielsen 1961; Nybelin 1977; Mutter 2005; Kogan 2011; Argyriou et al., 2018). These taxa are  part of Tintori et al. (2014a)’s “Triassic Early Fish Fauna” (TEFF).

### Dienerian, Induan, Early Triassic
**Madagascar**: 
Middle Sakamena Group in northwestern Madagascar
Dienerian, Induan,Early Triassic
By Lehman (1952) for the Dienerian Saurichthys madagascariensis Piveteau, 1944-45


**Greenland**:
In East Greenland, which is famous for Griesbachian aged fish fossils (see above), there is a horizon yielding Dienerian aged fishes (“stegocephalian-horizon” of Nielsen 1942; Nielsen 1949; “Zone VI” of Nielsen 1961; Surlyk et al., 2017). However, fossils appear to be few in these beds (Nielsen 1961). In addition, two western Canadian occurrences have been dated as Dienerian: a parasemionotid collected in Alberta (Davies et al., 1997) and a bobasatraniid reported from British Columbia (Wignall and Newton 2003). There are also occurrences of possibly Dienerian aged actinopterygians in Idaho, United States (Tanner 1936; Romano et al., 2012).


### Smithian，Olenekian, Early Triassic
**Spitzbergen (Svalbard)**  
The Fish Niveau is well constrained to the middle to late Smithian of the Lusitaniadalen Member by the middle Smithian Euflemingites romunderi and smaller lower-upper Smithian Wasatchites tardus ammonoid zones (Hammer et al., 2019; Kear et al., 2023). The main body of work on Triassic coelacanths from the archipelago of Svalbard is that of Stensiö (1921). Most of the material used in their work was collected by several expeditions between 1912 and 1918 from the Fish Niveau.

**Arcadia Formation** (Australia) Olenekian, Early Triassic


### Spathian，Olenekian, Early Triassic
**Spitzbergen (Svalbard)**
The *Grippia Niveau* was placed between the underlying Fish Niveau and the overlying Lower Saurian Niveau, and subsequently a concretion-rich layer found at Agardhbukta and Milne Edwardsfjellet was interpreted as being the Grippia Niveau (Wiman, 1933). Hansen et al. (2018) determined the bonebed as being early or early/middle Spathian in age based on stratigraphy and conodonts, although the lack of ammonoids makes it difficult to correlate to any specific biostratigraphic zone.

Some material described by Stensiö (1921), most importantly a lungfish tooth plate, was collected from the *Lower Saurian Niveau*, located at the top of the Vendomdalen Member of the Vikinghøgda Formation, dated to the late Spathian (late Early Triassic) (Hansen et al., 2018).

Well-dated Spathian bony fish are known from China, Romania, and the western United States.

China: Nanlinghu Formation in eastern China (Anhui Province), a perleidid (Chaohuperleidus) and a saurichthyid have been described (Sun et al., 2013; Tintori et al., 2014b).

From Romania, cranial remains of the actinistian Dobrogeria have been described (Cavin and Gr˘adinaru 2014), and material of additional taxa is currently under study (work in progress). From northeast Nevada, an indeterminate actinopterygian postcranium (a ptycholepid) and a large, yet undescribed skull are known (Romano et al., 2017). Furthermore, complete specimens of Bobasatrania from Spathian deposits of Idaho (cf. Brayard et al., 2017) are currently under study by the author. Another probable Spathian occurrence is known from Spitsbergen (a specimen of Saurichthys; cf. Kogan and Romano 2016b). The Gogolin beds (Upper Buntsandstein) of Upper Silesia, Poland, yield fossils of Saurichthys, Nephrotus, and actinistians (cf. Romano et al., 2017 for references). Here, I include the fishes from Gogolin in the Spathian substage (see Kowal-Linka and Bodzioch 2017).

## MIDDLE Triassic: 
### Aegean. Early Anisian
Romano (2021): Fossils were collected from the Upper Buntsandstein in Alsace, France (Grès à Voltzia), and near Durlach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, from where the following taxa have been described: *Dipteronotus* (*Praesemionotus*), *Dorsolepis*, *Pericentrophorus*, *Pygopterus*, *Saurichthys*, and actinistians (Wilser 1923; Jörg 1969; Gall et al., 1974; Schultze and Kriwet 1999; Gall and Grauvogel-Stamm 2005). 
Except for *Pygopterus* and *Saurichthys*, these genera are not yet known from deposits older than Middle Triassic. 
*Dorsolepis* and *Pericentrophorus* are probably endemic. These taxa are grouped in the “Triassic Middle Fish Fauna” (TMFF; Tintori et al., 2014a). Although an Early Anisian age was assumed based on index fossils (Gall and Grauvogel-Stamm 2005), Werneburg et al. (2014) questioned this age assignment and suggested that they were younger (Bithynian or Pelsonian).

### Bithynian, early Middle Anisian
Romano (2021): The Bithynian record of bony fishes is poor and restricted to a few occurrences in the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, and possibly Slovenia.

The Fossil Hill Member of the Favret Formation in Nevada has yielded cranial material of Saurichthys together with other isolated bony fish remains (Sander et al., 1994; Rieppel et al., 1996). 

Specimens of Eosemionotus, Gyrolepis, Saurichthys and other actinopterygians have been collected from the lower beds of the Vossenveld Formation in the Netherlands, which are Bithynian in age (Oosterink and Poppe 1979; Oosterink 1986; Maxwell et al., 2016). 

From Germany, Werneburg et al. (2014) described small species of Saurichthys. These authors also mention the occurrence of Dipteronotus, cf. Peltoperleidus, and Eosemionotus. 

The Velika Planina Horizon (Slovenia), whose precise age is not known but is thought to be pre-Pelsonian, has produced specimens of Eosemionotus, Placopleurus, and Saurichthys (Hitij et al., 2010; Tintori et al., 2014a; Tintori et al., 2016). The Velika Planina Horizon is herein treated as Bithynian in age, although an Aegean age cannot currently be confidently excluded. Apart from Saurichthys, all other genera listed above have their first appearance datum in this interval.

### Pelsonian, late Middle Anisian
> Romano (2021): Localities in Europe (Italy, Slovenia) and China produce Pelsonian bony fishes, many of which have been studied intensively during recent years. The Strelovec Formation of Slovenia has yielded fossils of Eosemionotus, Habroichthys, Peltopleurus, Placopleurus, Marcopoloichthys, Perleidus, possibly Colobodus, and other actinopterygians (Hitij et al., 2010; Tintori et al., 2014a; Tintori et al., 2016). The Strelovec Formation has been treated as Pelsonian by several paleoichthyologists, and I provisionally follow this interpretation here; however, note that Miklavc et al. (2016) consider this formation as Illyrian aged because index fossils supporting a Pelsonian age are lacking. In Italy, a new locality in the Dolomites (Prà della Vacca/Kühwiesenkopf) has produced specimens of Bobasatrania, Dipteronotus, Habroichthys, Placopleurus. Peltoperleidus, Ptycholepis, and Saurichthys (Tintori et al., 2016).
> A rich ichthyofauna is known from two horizons in South China, which became famous as the Luoping Biota and Panxian Biota, respectively, both being almost the same age (Upper Member of the Guanling Formation; Benton et al., 2013). Sun et al. (2012) suggested a Pelsonian age for the Luoping fish beds and I herein follow these authors’ interpretation, although Tintori et al. (2016) argued for a younger (Illyrian?) age. Sun et al. (2016a) presented evidence for a Pelsonian age of the Panxian biota. The Panxian-Luoping fauna comprises the following actinopterygians: Altisolepis, Birgeria, Colobodus,
Diandongperleidus, Eosemionotus, Ferroxichthys, Frodoichthys,
Fuyuanichthys, Fuyuanperleidus, Gimlichthys, Gymnoichthys,
Habroichthys, Kyphosichthys, Louwoichthys, Luopingichthys,
Luopingperleidus, Luoxiongichthys, Marcopoloichthys,
Panxianichthys, Perleidus, Placopleurus, Platysiagum,
Pteronisculus, Robustichthys, Sangiorgioichthys, Saurichthys
(including Sinosaurichthys), Subortichthys, Venusichthys, and
Yelangichthys, as well as the actinistians Luopingcoelacanthus and
Yunnancoelacanthus (e.g. Wu et al., 2011, Geng et al., 2012; Sun
et al., 2012, Wen et al., 2012, Benton et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2013,
Wu et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014a, Xu et al., 2014b;Ma and Xu 2015,
Xu and Shen 2015; Sun et al., 2016b; Xu and Zhao, 2016; Wu et al.,
2018; Xu et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2019; Xu 2020a, Xu 2020c). These
are mostly endemic taxa, suggesting incipient regionally contrasted
ichthyofaunas in the eastern Tethys in the Pelsonian (as opposed to
the cosmopolitan faunas of the Griesbachian–Smithian interval).
The genera Eosemionotus, Marcopoloichthys, and Saurichthys are
known from coeval European localities. Only Birgeria,
Eosemionotus, Pteronisculus, and Saurichthys have pre-Pelsonian
occurrences, whereas all other genera have their first occurrence in
the Pelsonian. It is no wonder that Tintori et al. (2014a) uses the
term “explosion” for the Pelsonian, although the authenticity of this
rapid diversification requires critical testing (see below). Some of the
abovementioned genera (e.g. Habroichthys) are also known from
the Late Ladinian (Longobardian) Xingyi Biota (Sun et al., 2016a).

### Illyrian, Late Anisian
Romano (2021):Illyrian bony fishes are known from Europe (Germany, the
Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland). From the Middle Muschelkalk
of Germany, several taxa were described, including articulated
remains of Eosemionotus, as well as isolated bones of Saurichthys,
and scales of Colobodus and Gyrolepis (e.g. Schultze and Möller
1986; Romano et al., 2012). Plesker (1995) examined articulated
fossils of Colobodus, Dollopterus, and Gyrolepis (also see Stolley
1920; Schultze and Kriwet 1999). From early Illyrian beds in the
Netherlands, Maxwell et al. (2016) described a small species of
Saurichthys.
The famous collecting area ofMonte San Giorgio and Besano,
which extends across the border between Switzerland and Italy,
has yielded a plethora of well-preserved, articulated vertebrate
remains, including bony fishes. The fossils are mostly derived
from the Illyrian–Fassanian Besano Formation; hence, the
fossiliferous layers straddle the Anisian–Ladinian boundary
(Stockar et al., 2012). From the Illyrian part of the Besano
Formation, the following genera have been described:
Aetheodontus, Altisolepis, Besania, Birgeria, Bobasatrania,
Cephaloxenus, Colobodus, Crenilepis, Ctenognathichthys,
Eoeugnathus, Eosemionotus, Gracilignathichthys, Gyrolepis,
Habroichthys, ?Holophagus, Luganoia, Meridensia,
Nannolepis, ?Ophiopsis, Peltoperleidus, Peltopleurus,
Peripeltopleurus, Pholidopleurus, Placopleurus, Platysiagum,
Ptycholepis, Saurichthys, Ticinocolobodus, and Ticinolepis (e.g.
Brough 1939; Bürgin 1992, Bürgin 2004; López-Arbarello et al.,
2016; Maxwell et al., 2015; Mutter 2002; Mutter and Herzog
2004; Romano and Brinkmann 2009; PIMUZ collection
database). The ichthyofauna is diverse and contains endemic
genera but also genera that are known from other Anisian
localities (e.g. Birgeria, Eosemionotus, Gyrolepis, Placopleurus,
Platysiagum, Ptycholepis, Saurichthys). The deep-bodied
Bobasatrania first appeared in the latest Permian, and the
yougest complete body fossils are from the Illyrian (PIMUZ
collection database). Tooth plates referrable to Bobasatrania
from the Longobardian of Germany and France mark the last
appearance of this genus in the fossil record (Böttcher 2014).
Meanwhile, Luganoia has also been described from the Late
Ladinian Xingyi Biota (Sun et al., 2016a; Xu 2020b), suggesting
a longer temporal range than previously thought
(Illyrian–Longobardian) for this taxon.



### Fassanian, Early Ladinian
> Romano (2021): Identifiable remains of bony fishes from the Fassanian, the first substage of the Ladinian, are known from Europe (Switzerland, Italy, and Germany).
> Early Ladinian bony fishes are known from the Prosanto Formation in southeast Switzerland (Graubünden). This formation has produced fossils of the actinopterygians
> Archaeosemionotus, Besania, Colobodus, Ctenognathichthys,Ducanichthys, Eoeugnathus, Eosemionotus, Habroichthys, ?Legnonotus, Ophiopsis, Peltoperleidus, Peltopleurus, Placopleurus, Prohalecites, Saurichthys, and Stoppania (Bürgin et al., 1991; Bürgin and Herzog 2002; Herzog 2003; Herzog and Bürgin 2005; Lombardo et al., 2008), as well as of the actinistians *Foreyia* and *Ticinepomis* (Cavin et al., 2013; Cavin et al., 2017).
> In the classic collecting site Monte San Giorgio and Besano (Swiss-Italian borderland), several layers produce osteichthyan fossils of Fassanian age. These are restricted to the upper portion of the Besano Formation as well the lower part of the Meride Limestone (Cava inferiore, Cava superiore; Stockar 2010).
> The following taxa were recovered from the Fassanian aged beds of the Besano Formation:
> Altisolepis, Archaeosemionotus, Besania, Birgeria, Bobasatrania, Cephaloxenus, Colobodus, Crenilepis, Ctenognathichthys, Eoeugnathus, Eosemionotus, Gracilignathichthys, Gyrolepis, Habroichthys, Luganoia, Meridensia, Nannolepis, Peltoperleidus, Peltopleurus, Peripeltopleurus, Pholidopleurus, Placopleurus, Platysiagum, Ptycholepis (though nearly all specimens are from Illyrian beds), Saurichthys, Stoppania (“Dipteronotus”; see Lombardo et al., 2008), Ticinocolobodus, and Ticinolepis (e.g. Dames 1888; Mutter 2002; Mutter and Herzog 2004; Romano and Brinkmann 2009; Maxwell et al., 2015; López-Arbarello et al., 2016, López-Arbarello et al., 2019; PIMUZ collection database).
> From Cava inferiore and Cava superiore, the following taxa are known: Ctenognathichthys, Eosemionotus, Habroichthys, Placopleurus, Saurichthys, and Ticinolepis (e.g. Stockar et al., 2012; Tintori 2013; López-Arbarello et al., 2016, López-Arbarello et al., 2019; PIMUZ collection database).
> Additional occurrences of Fassanian bony fishes are known from the Southern Alps of northern Italy. From the Perledo area, the following taxa have been documented Archaeosemionotus, Ctenognathichthys, Habroichthys, Heptanema, Placopleurus, Saurichthys, and Stoppania. (see e.g. Tintori 2013; López-Arbarello et al., 2014; Renesto and Stockar 2018).
> From the uppermost Muschelkalk of Germany, specimens of the actinistians Garnbergia (Martin and Wenz 1984) and Hainbergia (Schweizer 1966), as well as the actinopterygian Gyrolepis (Stolley 1920; Plesker 1995) have been collected.
> The taxonomic composition of Fassanian localities in Germany, Switzerland and Italy is relatively similar at the genus level due to either the close paleogeographic proximity of the sites or due to seaway connections at the time of deposition (Schultze and Kriwet 1999).
>  Several of the genera listed above can also be found in Pelsonian (Upper Member of the Guanling Formation) and Longobardian (Zhuganpo Formation; Sun et al., 2016a) deposits in South China, suggesting that these taxa had a widespread distribution in the Tethys since at least the late Middle Anisian.
